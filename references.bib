	abstract = {In recent years, solar-induced chlorophyll ﬂuorescence (SIF) retrieved from spaceborne spectrometers has been extensively used as a proxy for terrestrial photosynthesis at relatively sparse temporal and spatial scales. The near-infrared band of the recently launched TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) features the required spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio to retrieve SIF in a spectral range devoid of atmospheric absorption features. We ﬁnd that initial TROPOMI spectra meet high expectations for a substantially improved spatiotemporal resolution (up to 7-km × 3.5-km pixels with daily revisit), representing a step change in SIF remote sensing capabilities. However, interpretation requires caution, as the broad range of viewing-illumination geometries covered by TROPOMI’s 2,600-km-wide swath needs to be taken into account. A ﬁrst intersensor comparison with OCO-2 (Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2) SIF shows excellent agreement, underscoring the high quality of TROPOMI’s SIF retrievals and the notable radiometric performance of the instrument.},

	abstract = {Great advances have been made in the last decade in quantifying and understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) with ground, atmospheric, and space observations. However, although global GPP estimates exist, each data set relies upon assumptions and none of the available data are based only on measurements. Consequently, there is no consensus on the global total GPP and large uncertainties exist in its benchmarking. The objective of this review is to assess how the different available data sets predict the spatiotemporal patterns of GPP, identify the differences among data sets, and highlight the main advantages/disadvantages of each data set. We compare GPP estimates for the historical period (1990–2009) from two observation-based data sets (Model Tree Ensemble and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) to coupled carbon-climate models and terrestrial carbon cycle models from the Fifth Climate Model Intercomparison Project and TRENDY projects and to a new hybrid data set (CARBONES). Results show a large range in the mean global GPP estimates. The different data sets broadly agree on GPP seasonal cycle in terms of phasing, while there is still discrepancy on the amplitude. For interannual variability (IAV) and trends, there is a clear separation between the observation-based data that show little IAV and trend, while the process-based models have large GPP variability and signiﬁcant trends. These results suggest that there is an urgent need to improve observation-based data sets and develop carbon cycle modeling with processes that are currently treated either very simplistically to correctly estimate present GPP and better quantify the future uptake of carbon dioxide by the world’s vegetation.},

For this analysis, we used 16 one-year-long data sets of carbon dioxide exchange measurements from European and US-American eddy covariance networks. These sites span from the boreal to Mediterranean climates, and include deciduous and evergreen forest, scrubland and crop ecosystems.},

This paper introduces and validates a machine learning approach dedicated to the upscaling of observations from the current global network of eddy covariance towers (FLUXNET). We present a new model TRee Induction ALgorithm (TRIAL) that performs hierarchical stratiﬁcation of the data set into units where particular multiple regressions for a target variable hold. We propose an ensemble approach (Evolving tRees with RandOm gRowth, ERROR) where the base learning algorithm is perturbed in order to gain a diverse sequence of different model trees which evolves over time.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Spectral Indices derived from multispectral remote sensing products are extensively used to monitor Earth system dynamics (e.g. vegetation dynamics, water bodies, fire regimes). The rapid increase of proposed spectral indices led to a high demand for catalogues of spectral indices and tools for their computation. However, most of these resources are either closed-source, outdated, unconnected to a catalogue or lacking a common Application Programming Interface (API). Here we present “Awesome Spectral Indices” (ASI), a standardized catalogue of spectral indices for Earth system research. ASI provides a comprehensive machine readable catalogue of spectral indices, which is linked to a Python library. ASI delivers a broad set of attributes for each spectral index, including names, formulas, and source references. The catalogue can be extended by the user community, ensuring that ASI remains current and enabling a wider range of scientific applications. Furthermore, the Python library enables the application of the catalogue to real-world data and thereby facilitates the efficient use of remote sensing resources in multiple Earth system domains.},

Recent improvements to our three dimensional radiative transfer model of a vegetated surface are described. Example simulation results and a validation exercise are discussed. The model was utilized to derive land cover speciﬁc NDVI–LAI and NDVI–FAPAR relations. The method therefore requires stratiﬁcation of global vegetation into cover types that are compatible with the radiative transfer model. Such a classiﬁcation based on vegetation structure is proposed and a simple method for its derivation is presented. Proof-of-concept results are given to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed method.},
